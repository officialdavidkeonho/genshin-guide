            <h1 class="postHeader">Team Building</h1>
            <p class="postText">To play in the most optimized and fun way, you have to know HOW to build a good team. But before you do, there are a few things you have to consider: character roles, Elemental Reactions, and Elemental Resonance.</p>
            <div class="breakline"></div>
            <h2 class="postHeader2">Character Roles</h2>
            <img class="postImg" src="img/2character/02-13.jpg">
            <p class="postText">There are 3 general types of characters you have on a team:</p>
            <ul class="postText" style="text-align: left; list-style: circle;">
                <li>MAIN DPS - Damage dealer built to maximize damage output. You should invest in these characters first since they will be on field most of the time.</li>
                <li>SUB DPS - Secondary source of damage with Elemental Reactions. They serve more as batteries, energy recharge and applies elemental statuses. They usually leave the field after unleashing their abilities.</li>
                <li>SUPPORT - Provide character buffs, healing, shielding, energy recharge. Responsible for keeping the team alive and giving more firepower.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="postText">A typical team most players build is a Main DPS, 1-2 Sub DPS, and 1-2 Support teams. You don&#8217t have to follow this strategy to a T, but this has been found to be the most optimal team arrangement.</p>
            <div class="breakline"></div>
            <h2 class="postHeader2">Elemental Reactions</h2>
            <img class="postImg" src="img/2character/02-14.gif">
            <p class="postText">Elemental Reactions are when two elements mix together and create a damage bonus. Depending on how you build your team, the damage output from the Elemental Reactions can greatly help your attack power. Also, it feels good to pull off!</p>
            <ul class="postText" style="text-align: left; list-style: circle;">
                <li>OVERLOADED - Electro + Pyro - Small AoE (Area of Effect) that deals Pyro DMG</li>
                <li>SUPERCONDUCT - Electro + Cryo - Deals AoE Cryo DMG and reduces physical resistance 40% for 12 seconds</li>
                <li>VAPORIZE - Hydro + Pyro - DMG x2</li>
                <li>REVERSE VAPROIZE - Pyro + Hydro - DMG x1.5</li>
                <li>MELT - Cryo + Pyro - DMG x2</li>
                <li>REVERSE MELT - Pyro + Cryo - DMG x1.5</li>
                <li>ELECTRO-CHARGED - Electro + Hydro - Deals Electro DMG over time on those and around who are Wet.</li>
                <li>FROZEN - Cryo + Hydro - Freezes target. Attacking with a heavy attack (Claymore, Plunging attack, Geo DMG, explosions) will Shatter the target</li>
                <li>SHATTER - Frozen + Heavy attack - DMG depends on the level and Elemental Mastery of the used character</li>
                <li>BURNING - Dendro + Pyro - deals Pyro DMG over time</li>
                <li>SWIRL - Anemo + Pyro, Electro, Hydro, Cryo - Deals elemental DMG to swirled element and spreads to nearby opponents</li>
                <li>CRYSTALLIZE - produces elemental shard that when picked up gives an elemental shield of said element</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="postText">You can experiment on opponents with a variety of character elements to decide on your team.</p>
            <div class="breakline"></div>
            <h2 class="postHeader2">Elemental Resonance</h2>
            <img class="postImg" src="img/2character/02-15.jpg">
            <p class="postText">Depending on surplus of certain elemental characters present in your party, certain passive effects can come into play.</p>
            <ul class="postText" style="text-align: left; list-style: circle;">
            <li>FERVENT FLAMES - 2 Pyro - Affected by Cryo -40%. ATK +25%</li>
            <li>SOOTHING WATER - 2 Hydro - Affected by Pyro -40%. Incoming healing +30%</li>
            <li>HIGH VOLTAGE - 2 Electro - Affected by Hydro -40%. Elemental Reactions with Electro have 100% chance to generate Electro Elemental Particles (energy for Elemental Bursts)</li>
            <li>SHATTERING ICE - 2 Cryo - Affected by Electro -40%. CRIT rate on Frozen or Cryo-affected enemies by +15%</li>
            <li>IMPETUOUS WINDS - Stamina consumption -15%. Movement SPD +10%. Shortens skill cooldown 5%</li>
            <li>ENDURING ROCK - 2 Geo - Shield strength +15%. Party characters in shield will DMG +15% and dealing DMG to enemies will Geo RES (resistance) -20% for 15s</li>
            <li>PROTECTIVE CANOPY - Any 4 unique Elements - All Elemental RES +15%, physical RES +15%</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="postText">This doesn&#8217t have to be in the forefront of your mind, but for optimizing certain strategies, this is good to keep in mind.</p>

            <h1 class="postHeader">Size DOES Matter</h1>
            <p class="postText">You might realize not all characters&#8217 heights are different, some short and some tall. You&#8217d think height shouldn&#8217t matter in gameplay, but it does!</p>
            <div class="breakline"></div>
            <h2 class="postHeader2">Running Speeds</h2>
            <img class="postImg" src="img/2character/02-16.gif">
            <p class="postText">The taller you are, the wider the running strides. It&#8217s by a small margin, but shorter characters run with less speed than the taller ones.</p>
            <h2 class="postHeader2">Exceptions</h2>
            <img class="postImg" src="img/2character/02-17.gif">
            <p class="postText">Major exceptions are Alternate Sprint characters (Ayaka and Mona) or Sayu&#8217s Elemental Skill Yoohoo Art: Fuuin Dash.</p>

            <img class="postImg" src="img/2character/02-18.gif">
            <p class="postText">In the same principle, shorter characters have a smaller distance and speed covered when scaling walls, unlike taller characters that cover more wall quicker.</p>

            <h1 class="postHeader">You Do NOT Need to Follow a Strategy</h1>
            <p class="postText">…particularly this one. Many guides for this game might say, “Choose this character! He&#8217s got the firepower!” or “This character&#8217s Healing stat overpowers the previous character&#8217s,” but in the end, the decision of which characters you use is entirely up to you!</p>
            <p class="postText">You can choose a certain team based on their Elements or weapons only, or mainly because their character designs look amazing. I&#8217m guilty of that 110%!</p>
            <img class="postImg" src="img/2character/02-19.jpg">
            <p class="postText">This is how my team is currently, but chances are, it&#8217s far from ideal. Although I have the spread of 4 unique Elements and weapons, I use most of my characters as main DPSs, Kokomi as the only healer and part-time Sub DPS. I rely heavily on the Elemental Reactions the characters create with each other, so with any Element, I use any character that reacts well with the Element left behind by the previous character&#8217s Element. According to a friend who is more knowledgeable about the game, my Artifacts are not the best-suited for my characters and “they work.. but you awcould do much more damage”.</p>
